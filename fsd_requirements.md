# TAPP Campaigns WordPress Plugin - Functional Requirements Document

**Version:** 1.0.0  
**Date:** January 2025  
**Purpose:** Requirements specification for WordPress plugin development  
**Target:** Enterprise-scale campaign management for internal teams

---

## 1. PROJECT OVERVIEW

### 1.1 What We're Building

A WordPress plugin that enables organizations to run time-boxed, invite-only product selection campaigns for internal teams. Think of it as an internal "flash sale" system where managers create campaigns, invite team members, and collect product selections during a specific time window.

### 1.2 Key Use Cases

- **Corporate Uniform Programs:** Employees select their work attire within a budget
- **Sales Incentives:** Top performers choose rewards from a curated product list
- **Team Building:** Groups order team merchandise or company swag
- **Seasonal Campaigns:** Quarterly or annual product allocation to departments
- **Employee Benefits:** Managed perk selection (holiday gifts, wellness items, etc.)

### 1.3 Scale Requirements

- **Users:** 1,000 - 10,000 concurrent users
- **Campaigns:** Up to 50 active campaigns simultaneously
- **Participants:** 1,000+ per campaign
- **Performance Target:** Page load under 2 seconds
- **Mobile:** Must work perfectly on iOS and Android

---

## 2. CRITICAL ARCHITECTURE DECISIONS

### 2.1 üö® FRONTEND-ONLY MANAGEMENT (CRITICAL!)

**REQUIREMENT:** Managers, CEOs, Department Heads NEVER access WordPress admin (/wp-admin).

**ALL campaign management happens on the live website frontend:**
- Creating campaigns
- Editing campaigns
- Adding participants
- Viewing analytics
- Exporting data
- Managing templates
- Configuring settings (for their scope)

**WordPress Admin (/wp-admin) is ONLY for:**
- Site administrators (actual WordPress admins)
- Initial plugin setup
- Global settings that affect all campaigns
- Debugging and maintenance

**Implementation Note:** Create a complete frontend management dashboard, probably at `/my-account/campaigns/` or similar URL structure using WooCommerce My Account as the base.

### 2.2 Team vs Sales Campaigns - Completely Separate

**NOT a toggle or dropdown.** These are fundamentally different campaign types with:
- Separate creation workflows
- Separate listing pages
- Different default settings
- Different templates

Users should click "Create Team Campaign" or "Create Sales Campaign" as two distinct actions.

### 2.3 Theme Integration - Not Isolated

**Must follow the active WordPress theme's design:**
- Use theme's container classes
- Adopt theme's typography
- Match theme's color scheme
- Use theme's button styles
- Respect theme's spacing system

**Specifically test with Woodmart theme** as that's the primary target.

### 2.4 Database Design

**Need 5 custom tables:**
1. Campaigns table (core campaign data)
2. Campaign-Products junction (which products in which campaign)
3. Participants table (who's invited to which campaign)
4. Responses table (user selections with version tracking)
5. Campaign meta table (flexible key-value storage)

**Performance requirements:**
- Proper indexes on frequently queried columns
- Support for 10,000 users without slowdown
- Efficient queries (no N+1 problems)
- Pagination for large datasets

---

## 3. USER ROLES & PERMISSIONS

### 3.1 Role Definitions

**Roles come from TAPP Onboarding Plugin:**
```

1. `tapp_department`
2. `department`
3. `user_department`

Supports both:
- **Flat structure:** Marketing, Sales, IT, HR
